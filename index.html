				Hola, I'm Tim; I'm from northern Ohio. I'm a software developer and
				amateur futurist with many interests.
			</br></br>
				I love all things computing. I have a bachelor of science degree
				in computer science from Kent State University.
			</br></br>
				I'm passionate about designing and creating software. I'm interested in web
				programming and web design. I love programming languages.
			</br>
				I spend much of
				my free time researching computing-related topics including security, artificial
				intelligence, algorithms, software engineering in general, systems design,
				scientific computing, and the history of computer science.
			</br></br>
				Science, technology, art, and philosophy have been the major threads
				that have run through my life.
			</br></br>
				I enjoy finding informative, inspiring articles and talks about programming
				and computer science.
				<br>
				Here is an unordered, expanding list of some that I think are important and/or interesting.
			</br></br>
			 	I'm always learning.
			</br>
				<a href="books.html" id="booksLink" target="_blank">Here's</a> a subset of noteworthy books that
				I've read in the past several years.
			<br></br>
				I have a bachelor of science degree in geology.
			</br></br>
				I'm very involved with nutrition, food, health, and fitness.
				I love hiking, biking, and lifting weights. I (try to) eat healthfully.
			</br></br>
				I'm endlessly inspired by music. I've been playing guitar and
				recording music for what seems like a long time.
			</br></br>
				I'm a student of the mind and the self.
			</br>
				I'm interested in self-improvement, time management, productivity, psychology,
				and not least - what might be considered biohacking.
			</br></br>
				I'm also a cactus enthusiast.
